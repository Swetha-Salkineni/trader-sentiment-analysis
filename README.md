# Trader Behavior & Market Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between crypto trader performance and market sentiment using historical trade data and the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index.

We use machine learning models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** to predict whether a trade resulted in **Profit**, **Loss**, or **Neutral**, based on trade features and market sentiment.

## Files Included

- [`Trader_Sentiment_Analysis_Swetha.ipynb`](./Trader_Sentiment_Analysis_Swetha.ipynb) – Final Colab notebook with data analysis, preprocessing, and model training
- `README.md` – Project description and overview
- *(Optional)*: `Trader_Sentiment_Analysis.pdf` – Exported version of the notebook

## Key Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (log transforms, datetime features, encoding)
- Market Sentiment Merging (Fear/Greed Index)
- Random Forest and XGBoost Classifiers
- Confusion Matrix & Feature Importance
- Accuracy Evaluation & Insights

## Key Insights
- Time and market sentiment have a strong effect on trader outcomes.
- The `Size USD`, `Fee`, and `Direction` are major predictors of profit or loss.
- XGBoost outperformed baseline models, achieving higher accuracy.

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for Visualization
- Scikit-learn for Modeling & Evaluation
- XGBoost for Gradient Boosting Classification
- Google Colab
